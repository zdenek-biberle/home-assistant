### Manual
1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `homeassistant-meshtastic`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/meshtastic/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Meshtastic"

# Documentation

## Supported Platforms
### Sensor / Binary Sensor
For nodes selected as part of the configuration, metrics are exposed as corresponding sensors.

Even though integration is classified as `local_polling` it predominantly operates as `local_push` and home assistant is notified
as soon as new state is available. Polling is only used as fallback should the push mechanism stop working.

### [Notification](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/notify/)
Using notification platform and the generated `notify.mesh_*` entities is the recommended way to send messages to the mesh when you don't need control over all the details 
(which gateway to use, acknowledgements, etc.)

Depending on your needs, all nodes from the gateway's node database as well as the channels can be made available as notification targets.


Note: Support is based on new [entity notification platform](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/04/10/new-notify-entity-platform/), 
for an example on how to use it, see [official documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/notify/#example-with-the-entity-platform-notify-action).

### [Automation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/)

For nodes selected as part of the configuration, device triggers and device actions are available.
Prefer using device actions and triggers in your automation over using (service) actions.

#### Triggers
There are triggers when messages have been sent or have been received.
Gateway nodes offer more triggers than other nodes. You can further refine the triggers to only fire when a message was 
sent/received on a particular channel or as direct message.


#### Actions
 * Send Direct Message
 * Request Telemetry
 * Request Position

Note: Ensure you have a delay before the action if your automations are triggered by meshtastic device trigger,
otherwise you risk that your action triggered message is being dropped by meshtastic firmware because
it is still busy with receiving / sending other mesh messages.

  mode: single
```

If you don't want to use the recommend notification platform for sending messages (e.g. if you don't want to clutter your Home Assistant instance with potentially hundreds of notify mesh entities), 
you can still handle incoming text messages from any public node and reply to these messages. 
This is useful if to want to reply to incoming direct messages with a standard message, use a LLM or handle various commands with automations.

To do this, create a new Home Assistant automation that triggers on "Manual Events" and put `meshtastic_api_text_message` as the "Event Type". This will cause this automation to get triggerred on all incoming channel and direct messages. You will get events that include this information:

```yaml
trigger:
  event:
    event_type: meshtastic_api_text_message
    data:
      data:
        from: 1127918844
        to:
          node: null
          channel: 0
        gateway: 862525748
        message: Sample Message
```

From contains the node id of the sender of the message, to will have the node id of the gateway for direct messages, or a gateway channel id if the message is directed at the channel. 
Note that the channel id is dependent on the gateway node, so make sure you are using the proper gateway node when replying using that channel id. 

You can create conditions in the automation to filter out the incoming messages you want or you can directly filter in the trigger.
For example to filter out messages addressed to your gateway node, use this condition with your node id.

```
{{ trigger.event.data.data.to.node == 862525748 }}
```

To filter out messages addresses at the primary channel (Channel 0 is typically LONGFAST), use this condition:

```
{{ trigger.event.data.data.to.channel == 0 }}
```

You can also forward these messages as notifications to your phone, etc. For example:

```
Meshtastic message from ({{ trigger.event.data.data.from }}): {{ trigger.event.data.data.message }}
```

To reply to a text message in this situation, add a 2 second or more delay action and then an action called `Meshtastic 'Send Text'` to your automation. You need to add a short delay to make sure your Meshtastic device is idle before replying. Change the `Meshtastic 'Send Text'` action to edit in yaml and change the `to`, `from` and `text` values to something like his:

```
action: meshtastic.send_text
metadata: {}
data:
  ack: false
  from: "{{ trigger.event.data.data.gateway }}"
  to: "{{ trigger.event.data.data.from }}"
  text: "ECHO: {{ trigger.event.data.data.message }}"
```

In the example above, we echo back an incoming direct message.

</details>

### [Logbook](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logbook/)

Direct messages or channel messages are recorded in the log book. 
Each gateway has an entity for direct messages and its channels, you can navigate to the device and select the entitiy
to see an extract of the logbook, or you can navigate to the logbook and filter for the desired entities there. 

Note: When logbook is not enabled, messages are not recorded.

### [Device Tracker](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/device_tracker/)

For nodes selected as part of the configuration, their position is exposed as a device tracker.
You can see the nodes on home assistant map accordingly and home assistant will report if 
node is at home or away.

### Services / [Actions](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/07/16/service-actions/)

Use the available actions if you need more control compared to other methods to interact with
meshtastic devices. Certain actions need you to understand meshtastic details and are not recommended 
for the average user. 

## [Meshtastic Web Client](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/web-client/)

In order to enable manual interaction with gateway nodes and because of the limitation of meshtastic firmware
that only allows one single connection, this integration offers a workaround by exposing a meshtastic client http api
for each configured gateway. The bundled meshtastic web client can then be connected
to this integration directly and the integration will act as a proxy.

This also has the added benefit that it allows you to connect to meshtastic devices via the web client
that are not connected via TCP (like serial or bluetooth) or don't support TCP at all (e.g. nRF based nodes).

**Security Note**: As a side effect, enabling this feature results in unauthenticated access to your gateway nodes for 
anyone that can reach your home assistant instance (because meshtastic does not support authentication on the http api).
Make sure to only use this feature if your home assistant instance is running in a trusted environment!

To access the web client, perform the following steps:

In Home Assistant:
1. Enable the feature in the integration configuration
2. Navigate to the "Meshtastic" menu item. If you don't see it, reload home assistant interface
3. Press the "Open" button of the desired gateway to launch the web client

Inside the Meshtastic Web Client:

4. Press "New Connection" - the correct hostname is already populated
5. Press "Connect"
